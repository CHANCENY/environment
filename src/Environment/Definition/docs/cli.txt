\033[4mHow to set up\033[0m

\033[32mThis package can automatically set itself up as follows:
  - The folder `.configs` will be created on the webroot.
  - This folder will contain two subfolders: `.definition` and `.store`.
  - In `.definition`, the file `definition.yml` will be created with the following keys:
     - `hash`: Contains a hash string used to save the configurations.
     - `is_hash`: Set to `true` or `false` to specify if configurations need to be hashed before saving.
     - `enforce_backup`: Set to `true` or `false` to enforce backups.
     - `separation_mode`: Set to `true` or `false` to save configurations in separate files.
     - `max_file_size`: Specifies the maximum file size for saving configurations.
     - `store`: Contains the `.store` path.
  - Additional important files will also be created in the `.definition` folder.
  - The `.store` folder is where configurations will be saved.
